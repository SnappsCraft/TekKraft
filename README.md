TekKraft
========

An Open-Source Tech Mod for Minecraft 1.7 and Above

What is TekKraft?
=================

TekKraft is an OpenSource Minecraft Mod that adds CW (Craft Watts) to the game and uses it to power machines. There's a lot you can do with CW but you can learn that from the wiki when I finish it. There is, literally, so many things I want to add onto this mod. So much that I may have to divide the mod into different modules.

Build Version Scheme
====================

Here I will tell you how you can figure out what the version is just by looking at the file name.

b = bleeding build, not stable at all, only for the faint of heart!
a = alpha build, not really stable, but not really unstable
p = premier build, really stable!
